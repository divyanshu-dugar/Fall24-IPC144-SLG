## Coding Questions

#### **Question 1 (4 marks)**  
**Write the following function:**  
```c
void shiftPosition(struct Track* track, int steps);
```  
This function is passed a pointer to a `Track` struct and an integer `steps`. The function updates the `currentPosition` member of the `Track` by moving it `steps` forward if positive, or backward if negative. The position should not exceed the `maxPosition` of the track or go below 0. If the value goes beyond `maxPosition`, set it to `maxPosition`. If it goes below 0, set it to 0.

#### **Question 2 (5 marks)**  
**Write the following function:**  
```c
void categorizeTracks(int threshold, struct Track tracks[], int size, int* above, int* below, int* equal);
```  
This function takes the following parameters:  
- `threshold`: an integer to compare the `length` member of the tracks against.  
- `tracks`: an array of `Track` structs.  
- `size`: the number of elements in the `tracks` array.  
- `above`, `below`, `equal`: pointers to integers where the function will store counts of tracks longer than, shorter than, or equal to the threshold length.

#### **Question 3 (6 marks)**  
**Write the following function:**  
```c
int insertAt(struct Track* track, const char str[], int index);
```  
This function is passed a pointer to a `Track` struct, a null-terminated string `str`, and an integer `index`. It inserts the string into the `data` member of the `Track` at the specified `index`. If the insertion goes beyond the current `length`, append the string to the end. Update the `length` member to reflect the new size of the string. If the `index` is out of bounds (negative or beyond the `maxLength`), return -1; otherwise, return 0.  

---

#### **Question 4 (4 marks)**  
**Write the following function:**  
```c
void updateStatus(const char filename[], struct Track tracks[], int size, int status);
```  
This function takes the following parameters:  
- `filename`: the name of a file where track details are stored.  
- `tracks`: an array of `Track` structs.  
- `size`: the size of the `tracks` array.  
- `status`: an integer representing the new status to assign to each track.  

The function updates the `status` member of each `Track` in the array with the provided `status` value and writes each updated track's details to the file in the format:  
`<track_name> : <status>`  

---

#### **Question 5 (6 marks)**  
**Write the following function:**  
```c
int mergeTracks(struct Track* dest, struct Track* source);
```  
This function is passed two pointers to `Track` structs: `dest` and `source`. It appends the `data` from the `source` track to the `dest` track starting from the `currentPosition` in `dest`. Update the `length` of the `dest` track. If the combined length exceeds the `maxLength` of `dest`, truncate the added data to fit. Return the number of characters successfully appended.  

---

#### **Question 6 (5 marks)**  
**Write the following function:**  
```c
void printTrackDetails(const char filename[], struct Track tracks[], int size, int detailed);
```  
This function is passed:  
- `filename`: the name of the file where the track details will be saved.  
- `tracks` and `size`: an array of `Track` structs and its size.  
- `detailed`: a flag indicating whether to include extra details.  

The function writes each trackâ€™s `data` member to the file. If `detailed` is 1, include additional information, such as the `currentPosition` and `length`, in the format:  
`<track_name> (Position: <currentPosition>, Length: <length>)`.  
If `detailed` is 0, write only the `track_name`.

#### File System

**Question:**  
Write the following function:

```c
int readTracks(const char filename[], struct Track tracks[], int maxTracks);
```

This function is passed the name of a file where each line of the file contains a string of track data. Other than the newline character, all characters within the line are valid. You may assume that no line is longer than 500 characters. This function will read each line from the file and store each line into a separate element of the `tracks` array. The array has a maximum capacity of `maxTracks`, therefore only `maxTracks` lines should be read into the array. The function returns the number of lines successfully read. The initial position for each `Track` should be set to 0. The length of each track should correspond to the length of the line read in.

For example, suppose your file contains the following lines:

```
Song of the Century
Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Wake Me Up When September Ends
```

You would store this information into the first 3 elements of `tracks`. The position for all three would be initialized to 0. The length of the first track would be 20, the second would be 26, and the third would be 27. The function would return 3.
