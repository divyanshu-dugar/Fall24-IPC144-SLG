### Week-3 Coding Question:

Write a C program that takes the total number of hours and minutes from the user, then calculates and displays the total number of seconds. The following functions are to be created to achieve the desired task:

- **Group 1**: `int getHours();`  
  This function will prompt the user to input the total number of hours and return the value.

- **Group 2**: `int getMinutes();`  
  This function will prompt the user to input the total number of minutes and return the value.

- **Group 3**: `int calculateSeconds(int hours, int minutes);`  
  This function will take the number of hours and minutes as input and return the total number of seconds.

- **Group 4**: `void showTotalSeconds(int totalSeconds);`  
  This function will display the total number of seconds.

- **Group 5**: `int main();`  
  This is the main function that will coordinate the execution of the program, calling the above functions as necessary.
