### Answer to the Walkthrough Question:

**Part 1: Fill in the blank on line 10 with the last digit of your student number.**

Since the question requires the **second-to-last** digit of your student number, you would need to replace the blank in the code with that digit. For example, if your student number was **149325227**, the second-to-last digit is **2**. So, the line would be:

```c
10. int flag = 2;
```

---

**Part 2: Exact Output of the Program**

Letâ€™s break down the program's execution based on the student number `149325227` (using `flag = 2`).

- The program starts by concatenating the string `word1` ("happy ") to the `result` string, so the first output will be:

    ```c
    1: happy 
    ```

- Next, the program checks the condition `flag % 2 == 0`. Since `flag` is `2`, this condition is **true**, and it enters the `if` block:
    - `modifyString(word2)` is called with `word2 = "puppies "`. 
    - The `modifyString` function iterates over `word2` and converts every character at even indices to uppercase:
        - `word2` becomes `"PUPPIES "` (all letters at even indices become uppercase).
    - After modifying `word2`, it is concatenated to `result`, so now `result` becomes:
    
      ```c
      result = "happy PUPPIES "
      ```

    - The program then concatenates `word1` with `word3`, so `word1` becomes `"happy puppies barked "`.

    After this block, the program prints:

    ```c
    2: happy PUPPIES 
    3: happy puppies barked 
    ```

- Then, `word4 = "loudly "` is concatenated to `result`, so:

    ```c
    result = "happy PUPPIES loudly "
    ```

    It prints:

    ```c
    4: happy PUPPIES loudly 
    ```

- The program then copies `result` to `temp`, so `temp` becomes:

    ```c
    temp = "happy PUPPIES loudly "
    ```

    It prints:

    ```c
    5: happy PUPPIES loudly 
    6: happy PUPPIES loudly 
    ```

- The program checks if `result` and `temp` are equal. Since both are the same, it enters the `if` block:
    - `result` is set to `word5 = "yesterday "` and `temp` is appended to it, followed by `word1`. 
    - `result` becomes:

      ```c
      result = "yesterday happy PUPPIES loudly happy puppies barked "
      ```

    - The program then prints:

    ```c
    7: yesterday happy PUPPIES loudly happy puppies barked 
    ```

- Finally, it prints the value of `temp` (which was not changed):

    ```c
    8: happy PUPPIES loudly 
    ```
